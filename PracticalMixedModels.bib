  abstract = {Section A of this paper uses the Canadian experience for private passenger automobiles to show (1) that merit rating is almost as effective as the class plan in separating the better risks from the poorer risks, (2) that both merit rating and class rating leave unanalyzed a considerable amount of variation among risks and (3) that certain available evidence supports the conclusion that annual mileage, which has long been felt to be an important measure of hazard, is a very significant cause of this unanalyzed variation among risks.Section B presents a method for obtaining relativities among groups on which a multiple classification system has been imposed. The customary method of calculating class relativities uses the total experience for each class with all subdivisions within the classes added together. With the customary method it is difficult to make a completely accurate adjustment for different distributions by territory or merit rating, because any change in the class relativities disturbs the other sets of relativities and conversely. It is shown that even if such an adjustment were made, the customary method of calculating relativities one set at a time does not reflect the relative credibility of each subgroup and does not produce the best fit to the actual data. Moreover it produces differences between the actual data and the fitted values which are far too large to be caused by chance. In addition, for private passenger automobile insurance in Canada, it is shown that two sets of relativities which are multiplied together cannot produce the best fit to the actual data, and some of the consequences of trying to do so are explained. Some methods are advanced whereby all sets of relativities for classes, merit ratings, territories, and so forth, can be calculated simultaneously, which will overcome all the deficiencies in the customary method. These improved methods use the technique of minimizing a measure (technically known as the chi-square test) of the differences between the actual data and the fitted values. Some applications to other lines of insurance are mentioned.},

  abstract = {The paper gives details of statistical modelling techniques which can be used to estimate risk and office premiums from past claims data. The methods described allow premiums to be estimated for any combinaton of rating factors, and produce standard errors of the risk premium. The statistical package GLIM is used for analysing claims experience, and GLIM terminology is used and explained thoughout the paper. Arguments are put forward for modelling frequency and severity separately for different claim types. Fitted values can be used to estimate risk premiums, and the incorporation of expenses allows for the estimation of office premiums. Particular attention is given to the treatment of no claim discount. The paper also discusses possible uses of the modelled premiums. These include the construction of 'standardised' one way tables and the analysis of experience by postal code and model of vehicle. Also discussed is the possibility of using the results for assessing the impact of competition, and for finding 'niche' markets in which an insurer can operate both competitively and profitably.},

We propose to amend these shortcomings by an appropriate definition of the regression parameters:–intercept–slopeContrary to standard practice the intercept should however not be defined as the value at time zero but as the value of the regression line at the barycenter of time. With these definitions regression parameters which are uncorrected in the collective can be estimated separately by standard one dimensional credibility techniques.A similar convenient reparametrization can also be achieved in the general regression case. The good choice for the regression parameters is such as to turn the design matrix into an array with orthogonal columns.},

It is not surprising that the “classical actuary” has mostly been involved in solving the actuarial equivalent of this problem in insurance, namely                            Given               : risks               R               1               R               2               …                                R                 n                              no contagion, homogeneous group,                                         Find               : the proper (common) rate for all risks in the given class.                          There have, of course, always been actuaries who have questioned the assumptions of independence (no contagion) and/or identical distribution (homogeneity). As long as ratemaking is considered equivalent to the determination of the mean, there seem to be no additional difficulties if the hypothesis of independence is dropped. But is there a way to drop the condition of homogeneity (identical distribution)?},

We assume that the reader is either learning, or is familiar with actuarial science. It can be seen as a companion to standard textbooks on actuarial science. This book is intended for various audiences: students, researchers, and actuaries. As explained in cite Kendrick et al. (2006) (discussing the importance of computational economics) \textbackslash our thesis is that computational economics o ers a way to improve this situation and to bring new life into the teaching of economics in colleges and universities [...] computational economics provides an opportunity for some students to move away from too much use of the lecture-exam paradigm and more use of a laboratorypaper paradigm in teaching under graduate economics. This opens the door for more creative activity on the part of the students by giving them models developed by previous generations and challenging them to modify those models." Based on the assumption that the same holds for computational actuarial science, we decided to publish this book. As claimed by computational scientists, computational actuarial science might simply refer to modern actuarial science methods. Computational methods started probably in the 1950s with Dwyer (1951) and von Neumann (1951). The rst one emphasized the importance of linear computations, and the second one the importance of massive computations, using random number generations (and Monte Carlo methods), while (at that time) access to digital computers was not widespread"--},

As such, GLMs can model a wide variety of data types including counts, proportions, and binary outcomes or positive quantities.The book is designed with the student in mind, making it suitable for self-study or a structured course. Beginning with an introduction to linear regression, the book also devotes time to advanced topics not typically included in introductory textbooks. It features chapter introductions and summaries, clear examples, and many practice problems, all carefully designed to balance theory and practice. The text also provides a working knowledge of applied statistical practice through the extensive use of R, which is integrated into the text. Other features include: • Advanced topics such as power variance functions, saddlepoint approximations, likelihood score tests, modified profile likelihood, small-dispersion asymptotics, and randomized quantile residuals • Nearly 100 data sets in the companion R package GLMsData • Examples that are cross-referenced to the companion data set, allowing readers to load the data and follow the analysis in their own R session},

Our definition produces residuals that are exactly normal, apart from sampling variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted distribution function for each response value and finding the equivalent standard normal quantile. Our definition includes some randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this article to three example data sets.]},

  abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

In addition, a longitudinal data interpretation suggests additional models and techniques that actuaries can use in credibility ratemaking.

However, collateral data from other contracts in the same portfolio is not used, in spite of intuitive feelings that this data would contain additional evidence about the quality of the risk collective from which the portfolio was drawn. By using a hierarchical model, one makes the individual risk parameters exchangeable, in the sense of de Finetti, and a modified credibility formula is obtained which uses the collateral data in an intuitively satisfying manner. The homogeneous formula of Buehlmann and Straub is obtained as a limiting case when the hyperprior distribution becomes "diffuse".},

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

  abstract = {We consider hierarchical generalized linear models which allow extra error components in the linear predictors of generalized linear models. The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models. We use a generalization of Henderson's joint likelihood, called a hierarchical or h-likelihood, for inferences from hierarchical generalized linear models. This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the h-likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile h-likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi-likelihood and extended quasi-likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson-gamma, binomial-beta and gamma-inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population-averaged and subject-specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.},

  abstract = {We reconsider the problem of producing fair and accurate tariffs based on aggregated insurance data giving numbers of claims and total costs for the claims. Jørgensen and de Souza (Scand Actuarial J., 1994) assumed Poisson arrival of claims and gamma distributed costs for individual claims. Jørgensen and de Souza (1994) directly modelled the risk or expected cost of claims per insured unit, μ say. They observed that the dependence of the likelihood function on μ is as for a linear exponential family, so that modelling similar to that of generalized linear models is possible. In this paper we observe that, when modelling the cost of insurance claims, it is generally necessary to model the dispersion of the costs as well as their mean. In order to model the dispersion we use the framework of double generalized linear models. Modelling the dispersion increases the precision of the estimated tariffs. The use of double generalized linear models also allows us to handle the case where only the total cost of claims and not the number of claims has been recorded.},

A multivariate analysis revealed that after correction for previous forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), age, height, change in height, and cigarette smoking in the child, or adolescent, maternal cigarette smoking significantly lowered the expected average annual increase in FEV1 (P = 0.015). On the basis of this analysis, it is estimated that if two children have the same initial FEV1, age, height, increase in height, and personal cigarette-smoking history, but the mother of one has smoked throughout the child's life whereas the mother of the other has not, the difference in the change in FEV1 over time in the exposed child, as compared with that in the unexposed child, will be approximately 28, 51, and 101 ml after one, two, and five years, respectively, or a reduction of 10.7, 9.5, and 7.0 per cent, respectively, in the expected increase. These results suggest that passive exposure to maternal cigarette smoke may have important effects on the development of pulmonary function in children.},
