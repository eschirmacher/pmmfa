This repository contains all the text and code used to generate 
[CAS Monograph 14: Practical Mixed Models for Actuaries](https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Practiced-Mixed_Models-for-Actuaries-Monograph-14_0.pdf). 
You can find the final PDF version on the 
[Casualty Actuarial Society](https://www.casact.org/) website 
under Publications & Research > [CAS Monographs](https://www.casact.org/publications-research/publications/flagship-publications/cas-monographs).

The book provides a practical introduction to an area of actuarial 
practice that is at the intersection of the theories of credibility
and mixed models. 
Text and important chunks of R code are mixed throughout to help 
you learn and implement the methods discussed.
While not all code is shown in the PDF, everything is available
to you in this repository.

The book was written with the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system.
